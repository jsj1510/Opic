Hello, Eva. This is sj j.

How’s everything?

I heard that you also like to go to the gym just like I do.

So, I have a few questions about your gym.

Do you mind?

First of all, what kind of exercise do you like?

In my case, I like jogging the most.

And... When do you usually go to the gym?

I usually go to the gym on the weekend because I’m very busy working.

What else... Oh!

Where is your gym?

I go to the gym called Zest Gym in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Lastly, I have one more question.

What is your favorite machine?

My favorite machine is treadmill.

Thank you very much.

I’m happy to get to know you.

Bye~
