Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my gym.

There is a gym called Zest Gym in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

I usually go to there on the weekend.

There are several things I can see.

First of all, there are staffs and personal trainers.

They are well-dressed with black and white uniforms.

They are very kind and nice.

Whenever I visit there, they offer great service.

Second, there is a parking lot.

It’s big so it’s easy to park my car.

Actually, I’m not a good driver so I need enough space to park my car.

Also, there are many different kinds of machines such as treadmill, stationary bicycles, and weight machines.

My favorite equipment is treadmill.

I like jogging and running because it’s good for my health.

If I have a chance, I wanna go there again.

This is about the gym (I usually go to).
