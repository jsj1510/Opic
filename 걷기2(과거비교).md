Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about walking.

In my opinion, people walk more than before.

That is because they want to keep their health.

Actually, they don’t have enough time to work out.

They are very busy working.

Therefore, They try to work out when they have free time.

Also, walking is very good for health.

All you have to do is walking with comfortable clothes and shoes.

It’s very easy.

When I get stressed from work, I like walking at the park.

I really enjoy walking and jogging with my friends.

Anyways, this is about walking.
