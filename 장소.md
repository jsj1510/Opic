Wow, This is a very interesting question.

Let me share about Department store.

There is a department store called Galleria in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

I usually go to there on the weekend.

There are several things I can see.

First of all, there are staffs.

They are well-dressed with black and white uniforms.

They are very kind and nice.

Whenever I visit there they offer great service.

Second, there is a parking lot.

It’s big so it’s easy to park my car.

Actually, I’m not a good driver so I need enough space to park my car.

Also, they have many different kinds of products such as clothes,

electronic devices and grocery.

Every weekend, my family likes to go department store for grocery shopping.

We usually buy food such as meat, vegetable and snacks.

If I have a chance, I wanna visit there again.

This is all about the department store I usually go to.
