Hello, Eva. This is sj j

How’s everything?

I heard that you also like to watch movies just like I do.

So, I have a few questions about watching movie.

Do you mind?

First of all, what kind of movie do you like?

In my case, I like romantic comedy the most.

And... When do you usually see a movie?

I usually see a movie on the weekend because I’m very busy working.

What else... Oh!

Where do you go to see a movie?

I go to CGV movie theater in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Lastly, I have one more question.

What is your favorite movie?

My favorite movie is Harry Potter.

Thank you very much.

I’m happy to get to know you.

Bye~
