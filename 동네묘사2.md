### 답변

Wow, This is a very interesting question.

I’d like to talk about a memorable experience in my neighborhood.

Last weekend, I went to the park in my neighborhood for jogging with my friends.

As you might know, jogging is really good for health.

We enjoyed it together.

It was very fun and exciting.

All of sudden, I found out that I lost my wallet.

I checked my pocket but there wasn’t.

I looked for it everywhere but I couldn’t find it.

I was so sad because the wallet was meaningful to me.

I learned that I should be more careful.

This is about a memorable experience in my neighborhood.
