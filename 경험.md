Wow, This is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my memorable experience at the department store(=shopping mall).

I usually go to a department store called the Galleria in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Last weekend, I went to the Galleria to buy something with my friends.

They have many defferent kinds of products such as clothes, electronic devices, and grocery.

So, I usually go there on the weekend for shopping.

Anyways, I was trying to find my credit card to pay my stuff, (oh my god)

I realized that I lost my wallet.

So, I looked for it everywhere. but I couldn’t find it.

I was so depressed because I needed my wallet and card.

Fortunately, my wallet was at home.

I learned that I should be more careful.

I can’t forget the day.

This is all about my memorable experience at the department store I usually go to.
