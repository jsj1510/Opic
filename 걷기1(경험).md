Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my walking experience.

Last weekend, I went to a park to walk with my friends.

I like to take a walk because it relieves my stress.

When I get stressed from work, I like walking at the park.

While I was walking, I realized that I lost my wallet.

I looked for it everywhere but I couldn’t find it.

So, I decided to walk.

It took about 2 hours to get my home.

I was very tired.

When I got home, my wallet was there.

I was happy to find my wallet.

I learned that I should be more careful.

I can’t forget the day.

This is about my memorable walking experience.
