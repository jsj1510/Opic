Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my domestic trip.

I like to visit Jeju Island during my summer vacation.

I prefer to go there because it’s very beautiful.

There are a lot of things to see.

First of all, there is a beautiful beach called the 중문.

I love to walk along the beach with my family.

Also, I like swimming at the beach.

It’s very fun and exciting.

Second, I eat local food.

Jeju Island is famous for seafood.

Especially, I love seafood barbeque.

It’s very delicious because it’s served fresh.

If I have a chance, I wanna go there again.

This is about my trip in my country.
