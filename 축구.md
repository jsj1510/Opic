Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about soccer.

I love watching soccer game.

I like to play soccer but I’m not that good.

So, I usually go to a stadium to watch soccer game on the weekend.

There is a stadium called the 상암 Stadium in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there on foot.

Oh! For your information, My favorite soccer player is 손흥민.

So, I’m a big fan of 토트넘.

Watching soccer game is very fun and exciting.

(and...) if you don’t know soccer well, I let you know the rules.

To play soccer, it needs a soccer ball and players.

Also, they need 11 players in each team.

To win the game, they have to make more points than the other.

If I have a chance, I wanna watch a game again.

This is about soccer.
