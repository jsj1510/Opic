Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my favorite sports.

I love watching baseball game.

I like to play baseball but I’m not that good.

So, I usually go to a stadium to watch baseball game on the weekend.

There is a stadium called the 잠실 Stadium in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Oh! For your information, My favorite baseball player is 류현진.

So, I’m a big fan of LA Dodgers.

류현진 is very good at playing baseball.
He is one of the famous pitchers in Korea.

I love watching a sporting event with my friends.

It’s very fun and exciting.

Also, it relieves my stress while seeing a game.

If I have a chance, I wanna watch a game again.

This is about my favorite sports.
