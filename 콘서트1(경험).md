Wow, This is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my memorable experience at the theater.

I usually go to the theater called Seoul Art Center in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Last weekend, I went to the theater for watching musical with my friends.

As you might know, I love to watch musical.

my favorite musical is Mama Mia.

It was very fun and exciting.

We enjoyed it together.

While I was watching Mama Mia,

I met my ex-girlfriend.

I was stunned and surprised because she was my first love.

She was looking good.

We noticed each other and smiled, I hope she will be happy.

I can’t forget the day.

This is all about my memorable experience at the theater (I usually go to).
