!! describe

wow this is a  very interseting question

let me share about the movie theater

there is a movie theater called cgv in my neighborhood

it is near my home.

it takes only 10 mint to get there

i usually go there on the weekend

There are several things I can see.

First of all, they are staffs.

They are well-dressed with black and white uniforms.

They are very kind and nice.

Whenever I visit there they offer great service.

Second, there is a parking lot.

It’s big so it’s easy to park my car.

Actually, I’m not a good driver so I need enough space to park my car.

Also, there is a big snack bar in the movie theater

They sell popcorns, coke and juice

I love to drink coke while i watch movie.

i really like it very much

If I have a chance, I wanna visit there again.

This is all about the movie theater store I usually go to.
