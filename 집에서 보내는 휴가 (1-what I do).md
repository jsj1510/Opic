Wow, this is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my vacation at home.

I do several things when I spend my vacation at home.

First of all, I cook for my family.

I cook cream pasta.

I prepare some ingredients such as noodle, cream sauce and vegetables.

It’s very delicious.

My family really loves it.

Second, I do some household chores.

I wash(=do) the dishes.

It’s very easy.

Also, I do the laundry.

There are a lot of clothes to be cleaned.

Therefore, I use a laundry machine.

It’s very convenient and useful.

Lastly, I go to a park called the Olympic Park in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

I go jogging and running.

It’s good for my health.

This is about my vacation at home.
