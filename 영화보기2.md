Wow, this is a very interesting question.

I’d like to talk about what I do before I go to the movie theater.

There are several things I do.

First of all, I check movie schedule by my smart phone.

It’s very convenient and useful. ⭐️

I like to use my smartphone.

Second, I book the tickets and confirm the seats.

Lastly, I pay the ticket with my credit card.

Sometimes, I get some discounts because I have a membership.

Watching movie is always fun and exciting.
