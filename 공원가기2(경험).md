Wow, This is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my memorable experience at the park.

I usually go to the park called Olympic park in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Last weekend, I went to the park for jogging with my friends.

There is a jogging track at the park.

I like to go jogging and running.

It’s good for my health.

Also, it relieves my stress.

Anyways, I was trying to find my credit card to buy water, (oh my god)

I realized that I lost my wallet.

So, I looked for it everywhere But I couldn’t find it.

I was so depressed because I needed my credit card.

Fortunately, my wallet was at my home.

I learned that I should be more careful.

I can’t forget the day.

This is all about my memorable experience at the park.
