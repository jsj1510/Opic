Wow, this is a very interesting question.

I’d love to talk about what I do with my family.

There are 4 people in my family; my parents and my sister.

There are several things I do with my family.

My family loves to do outdoor activities.

First of all, we really like to go for jogging.

There’s a park in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Also, there’s a jogging track at the park.

Jogging is very good for health ⭐️. 

In addition, it relieves my stress.

So, we go for jogging and running.

Second, we usually go to the movie theater on the weekend ⭐️.

We like to watch movies.

Therefore, when new movies are released,

we go to the movie theater for watching movies.

This is all about my family activities.
