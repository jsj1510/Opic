!! memorable

Wow, This is a very interesting question.

Let me share about my memorable experience at the movie theater

I usually go to the movie theater called CGV in my neighborhood.

It’s near my home.

It takes only 10 minutes to get there.

Last weekend, I went to the cgv for watich movie  with my friends.

As you might know, my favorite hobby is watching

It was very fun and exciting

We enjoyed it together

Anyways, I was trying to find my credit card to pay my ticket, omg

I realized that I lost my wallet.

So, I looked for it everywhere. but I couldn’t find it.

I was so depressed because I needed my wallet and card.

Fortunately, my wallet was at home.

I learned that I should be more careful.
